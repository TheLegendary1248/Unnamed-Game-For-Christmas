# Unnamed Game For Christmas
 An unfinished game that was made for a Secret Santa event
 Supposedly Started on **11/23/2021** as given by message timestamps  

 ...thankfully, to some degree, the intended recepient didn't even reply anymore just a few days after starting

The intent was to make a sort of dungeon-crawler like game, a roguelike as per my recepient's request   

The best thing that has come out of this was figuring out how to manipulate Unity's sprites mesh to create a Line Of Sight mask effect,  
and the knowledge that I have problems finishing things

**FAIR WARNING: REPO MAY BE RENAMED**
